    "The *Financial Services* industry experienced the greatest improvement in phishing training success over a 12-month period, increasing from 48% to 74% â€” a 26-point gain. Meanwhile, *Pharma & healthcare* showed the least progress, improving only 10 points. This highlights a significant disparity in training effectiveness across industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation\n",
    "Prioritize additional support and tailored training for industries with lower improvement rates such as *Pharma & healthcare* and *IT, software, internet*. Investigate possible causes like engagement, delivery methods, or content relevance to enhance outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction\n",
    "If current patterns hold, top-performing industries may stabilize, while lower-performing sectors risk stagnation or decline unless proactive measures are taken. Focused interventions could help bridge the performance gap in the coming year."
