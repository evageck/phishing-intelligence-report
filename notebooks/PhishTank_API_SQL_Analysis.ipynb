    "The most common feature combination among verified phishing URLs (57 instances) includes the use of HTTPS and the absence of an IP address. This indicates that phishing websites often adopt HTTPS to appear more legitimate and trustworthy. Also, the most common verified phishing URLs (57 instances) do **not** contain an IP address. This suggests that attackers are favoring domain-based URLs over raw IP addresses, likely to make the links appear more trustworthy and avoid detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation\n",
    "Security awareness training should emphasize that HTTPS does not guarantee a site's legitimacy. Detection tools and user training should not rely solely on spotting IP addresses in URLs as phishing indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction\n",
    "As phishing techniques evolve, we can expect an increasing number of phishing sites to use HTTPS by default, reducing the reliability of HTTPS as a standalone trust signal. The trend of using domain-based phishing URLs will continue to rise, as attackers mimic legitimate domain structures to evade user suspicion and automated filters.\n"
